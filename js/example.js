    { "description": "Amusement Arcade is NSS's most popular destination, and is first on everyone's list of things to experience when they arrive in Nashville. The park is full of great attractions like Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Space Mountain, and Jungle Cruise, and features lots of entertainment including parades, fireworks spectaculars, character meet and greets, and shows. However, the park can be overwhelming and become quite crowded, even during the low season.",
